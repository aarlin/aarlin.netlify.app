## üé® Themes Overview

[![Themes Preview Banner](https://img.lekoarts.de/gatsby/thin_banner.jpg)](https://themes.lekoarts.de)

## üíº Contents

This repository is a collection of my Gatsby themes, managed as a [monorepo](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/monorepos/) with [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) and [yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/).

- `.circleci`: Contains the configuration file for CircleCI
- `.github`: GitHub actions, templates for issues, and FUNDING file
- `cypress`: Contains the Cypress tests for `examples`
- `examples`: Contains the corresponding example sites for the `themes`. These projects can and should be used as a starter and will be copied over to their own repository. Hence they contain example data and additional Gatsby plugins (e.g. `gatsby-plugin-manifest` and `gatsby-plugin-offline`). The folder names are the contents after `gatsby-theme-*`
- `jest`: Primarily files for mocking functions/files in Jest tests
- `plop-templates`: Template for [plop.js](https://plopjs.com/)
- `scripts`: In order to run the tests on CircleCI some utility bash scripts are needed which are located here
- `themes`: Contains the themes themselves. They should only have the bare minimum of plugins installed (as `examples` can expand them) and also use `Theme UI` for styling. The naming of the folders must be `gatsby-theme-[name-with-dashes]` and the package name under the scope of `@lekoarts`
- `www`: Contains the source code for [themes.lekoarts.de](http://themes.lekoarts.de)

## ü§ù How to Contribute

Make sure that you have `yarn` installed on your machine (as it's mandatory for `yarn workspaces`). Fork this repository, clone it and run `yarn` in the root directory.

To launch the development server of an example site, use:

```sh
yarn workspace [examples/name] develop
```

Or for a build:

```sh
yarn workspace [examples/name] build
```

In the case of `examples/emma` this command would be `yarn workspace emma develop`. Now you can make changes to the respective theme and see them via Hot-Reloading.

Commit your changes to a feature branch of your fork and open up a PR against this repository. The PR will have checks in place (unit and end-to-end tests) which you can also run on your machine in preparation for the PR.

Have a look at the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn more.

#### Example usage

```js
// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog`,
      options: {
        showLineNumbers: false,
        navigation: [
          {
            title: `Blog`,
            slug: `/blog`
          },
          {
            title: `About`,
            slug: `/about`
          }
        ],
        externalLinks: [
          {
            name: `Twitter`,
            url: `https://twitter.com/lekoarts_de`
          },
          {
            name: `Instagram`,
            url: `https://www.instagram.com/lekoarts.de/`
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
};
```

#### Additional configuration

In addition to the theme options, there are a handful of items you can customize via the `siteMetadata` object in your site's `gatsby-config.js`

```js
// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  siteMetadata: {
    // Used for the title template on pages other than the index site
    siteTitle: `Lupin`,
    // Default title of the page
    siteTitleAlt: `Minimal Blog - @lekoarts/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog`,
    // Can be used for e.g. JSONLD
    siteHeadline: `Minimal Blog - Gatsby Theme from @lekoarts`,
    // Will be used to generate absolute URLs for og:image etc.
    siteUrl: `https://minimal-blog.lekoarts.de`,
    // Used for SEO
    siteDescription: `Typography driven, feature-rich blogging theme with minimal aesthetics. Includes tags/categories support and extensive features for code blocks such as live preview, line numbers, and line highlighting.`,
    // Will be set on the <html /> tag
    siteLanguage: `en`,
    // Used for og:image and must be placed inside the `static` folder
    siteImage: `/banner.jpg`,
    // Twitter Handle
    author: `@lekoarts_de`,
    // Links displayed in the header on the right side
    externalLinks: [
      {
        name: `Twitter`,
        url: `https://twitter.com/lekoarts_de`
      },
      {
        name: `Instagram`,
        url: `https://www.instagram.com/lekoarts.de/`
      }
    ],
    // Navigation links
    navigation: [
      {
        title: `Blog`,
        slug: `/blog`
      }
    ]
  }
};
```

If you want to add additional items to the navigation or external links (left and right side of header), add objects in the shape shown above to the arrays.

### Code Highlighting

Since this theme ships with [prism-react-renderer](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer) and [react-live](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live) certain additional features were added to code blocks. You can find an overview / usage example in the [example repository](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-themes/tree/master/examples/minimal-blog/content/posts/fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them/index.mdx)! If you want to change certain code styles or add additional language tabs, you need to shadow the file `src/@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog/styles/code.js`.

**Language tabs:**

When you add a language (such as e.g. `js` or `javascript`) to the code block, a little tab will appear at the top left corner.

````
```js
// code goes here
```
````

**Code titles:**

You can display a title (e.g. the file path) above the code block.

````
```jsx:title=your-title
// code goes here
```
````

Or without a specific language:

````
```:title=your-title
// code goes here
```
````

**Line highlighting:**

You can highlight single or multiple (or both) lines in a code block. You need to add a language.

````
```js {2,4-5}
const test = 3
const foo = 'bar'
const harry = 'potter'
const hermione = 'granger'
const ron = 'weasley'
```
````

**Hide line numbers:**

If you want to hide line numbers you can either globally disable them (see Theme options) or on a block-by-block basis. You can also combine that with the other attributes.

````
```noLineNumbers
// code goes here
```
````

**react-live:**

Add `react-live` to the code block (and render the component) to see a preview below it.

````
```js react-live
const onClick = () => {
  alert("You opened me");
};
render(<button onClick={onClick}>Alohomora!</button>);
```
````

### Shadowing

Please read the guide [Shadowing in Gatsby Themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/shadowing/) to understand how to customize the this theme! Generally speaking you will want to place your files into `src/@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog/` to shadow/override files.

### Adding content

#### Adding a new blog post

New blog posts will be shown on the index page (the three most recent ones) of this theme and on the blog overview page. They can be added by creating MDX files inside `content/posts`. General setup:

1. Create a new folder inside `content/posts`
1. Create a new `index.mdx` file, and add the frontmatter
1. Add images to the created folder (from step 1) you want to reference in your blog post
1. Reference an image as your `banner` in the frontmatter
1. Write your content below the frontmatter
1. Add a `slug` to the frontmatter to use a custom slug, e.g. `slug: "/my-slug"` (Optional)

**Frontmatter reference:**

```md
---
title: Introduction to "Defence against the Dark Arts"
date: 2019-11-07
description: Defence Against the Dark Arts (abbreviated as DADA) is a subject taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
tags:
  - Tutorial
  - Dark Arts
banner: ./defence-against-the-dark-arts.jpg
---
```

**The fields `description` and `banner` are optional!** If no description is provided, an excerpt of the blog post will be used. If no banner is provided, the default `siteImage` (from `siteMetadata`) is used.

The `date` field has to be written in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`!

#### Adding a new page

Additional pages can be created by placing MDX files inside `contents/pages`, e.g. an "About" or "Contact" page. You'll manually need to link to those pages, for example by adding them to the navigation (in `siteMetadata`). General instructions:

1. Create a new folder inside `content/pages`
1. Create a new `index.mdx` file, and add the frontmatter
1. Write your content below the frontmatter
1. Optionally add files/images to the folder you want to reference from the page

**Frontmatter reference:**

```md
---
title: About
slug: "/about"
---
```

#### Changing the "Hero" text

To edit the hero text ("Hi, I'm Lupin...), create a file at `src/@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog/texts/hero.mdx` to edit the text.

#### Changing the "Projects" part

To edit the projects part below "Latest posts", create a file at `src/@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog/texts/bottom.mdx` to edit the contents.

If you want to learn more about how you can use a Gatsby starter that is configured with a Gatsby theme, you can checkout this [shorter](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/using-a-gatsby-theme/) or [longer](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/using-a-theme/) tutorial. The tutorials don't exactly apply to this starter however the concepts are the same.

## üìù Using and modifying this starter

**Important Note:** Please read the guide [Shadowing in Gatsby Themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/shadowing/) to understand how to customize the underlying theme!

This starter creates a new Gatsby site that installs and configures the theme [`@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog`](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-themes/tree/master/themes/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog).

Have a look at the theme's README and files to see what options are available and how you can shadow the various components including Theme UI. Generally speaking you will want to place your files into `src/@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog/` to shadow/override files. The Theme UI config can be configured by shadowing its files in `src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/`.

### Code Highlighting

Since the underlying theme ships with [prism-react-renderer](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer) and [react-live](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live) certain additional features were added to code blocks.

If you want to change certain code styles or add additional language tabs, you need to shadow the file `src/@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog/styles/code.js`.

**Language tabs:**

When you add a language (such as e.g. `js` or `javascript`) to the code block, a little tab will appear at the top left corner.

````
```js
// code goes here
```
````

**Code titles:**

You can display a title (e.g. the file path) above the code block.

````
```jsx:title=your-title
// code goes here

Or without a specific language:

````

## üéì Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on Gatsby's website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

### Themes

- To learn more about Gatsby themes specifically, we recommend checking out the [theme docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/).

### General

- **For most developers, I recommend starting with the [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to Gatsby's documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Reference Guides_ and _Gatsby API_ sections in the sidebar.
