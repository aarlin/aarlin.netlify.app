**Prequisites**

* Java - should be able to run `java -version` in your terminal
* Apktool
* Android device 
* Cloud based storage - OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive

This a quick guide on how to grab assets from an APK folder.  
I'll be using a physical Android device for this guide

<Step number={1} title='Follow the steps for this [page](https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/install/) to get Apktool downloaded.'/>
   Keep this jar file and bat file if you're using Windows in a folder. We'll get back to this later.

<Step number={2} title='Download the app from Google Playstore you want to decode assets from.'/>
For this guide, I'll be using Fire Emblem Heroes as an example.

<Step number={3} title='Go search under your apps - **Files**'/>
  ![](/assets/images/blog-posts/decode-apk/files-app.png)

<Step number={4} title='Under **Installed apps**, click on the arrow button next to the app you want to export the APK file'/>
and select **Share**

<Step number={5} title='In my case, transfer the file over to Dropbox'/>
  ![](/assets/images/blog-posts/decode-apk/share-to-dropbox.png)

<Step number={6} title='Once the file transfer is complete, move the file to the folder where you downloaded the apktool'/>

<Step number={7} title='Run the following commands'/>
`java -jar apktool.jar d <apk_name>`. In this case, it would be `java -jar apktool.jar d feh.apk`
If you are using Windows, you can run `apktool.bat d <apk_name>`  

<Step number={8} title='The outputted folder should have the assets you want but under **.bin.lz** format'/>

<Step number={9} title='The following steps are specific for this apk.'/>
**.bin.lz** are xor encrytpted lz77 files. 
We can use [FEHDataExtractor](https://github.com/Lorenzooone/FEHDataExtractor/releases) to grab the internal data
