**Prequisites**

* Java - should be able to run `java -version` in your terminal
* Apktool
* Android device 
* Cloud based storage - OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive

This a quick guide on how to grab assets from an APK folder.  
I'll be using a physical Android device for this guide

1. Follow the steps for this [page](https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/install/) to get Apktool downloaded. 
   Keep this jar file and bat file if you're using Windows in a folder. We'll get back to this later.

2. Download the app from Google Playstore you want to decode assets from.
For this guide, I'll be using Fire Emblem Heroes as an example.

3. Go search under your apps - **Files**

4. Under **Installed apps**, click on the arrow button next to the app you want to export the APK file
and select **Share**

5. In my case, transfer the file over to Dropbox

6. Once the file transfer is complete, move the file to the folder where you downloaded the apktool 

7. Run the command `java -jar apktool.jar d <apk_name>`. In this case, it would be `java -jar apktool.jar d feh.apk`
If you are using Windows, you can run `apktool.bat d <apk_name>`  

8. The outputted folder should have the assets you want but under **.bin.lz** format

9. The following steps are specific for this apk. 
**.bin.lz** are xor encrytpted lz77 files. 
We can use [FEHDataExtractor](https://github.com/Lorenzooone/FEHDataExtractor/releases) to grab the internal data
