* Apktool
* Android device 
* Cloud based storage - OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive

## Tutorial

This a quick guide on how to grab assets from an APK folder.  
I'll be using a physical Android device for this guide

<Badge>1</Badge> Follow the steps for this [page](https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/install/) to get Apktool downloaded.
   Keep this jar file and bat file if you're using Windows in a folder. We'll get back to this later.

<Badge>2</Badge> Download the app from Google Playstore you want to decode assets from.
For this guide, I'll be using Fire Emblem Heroes as an example.

<Badge>3</Badge> Go search under your apps - **Files**
  
  ![](/assets/images/blog-posts/decode-apk/files-app.png)

<Badge>4</Badge> Under **Installed apps**, click on the arrow button next to the app you want to export the APK file
and select **Share**
 
  ![](/assets/images/blog-posts/decode-apk/installed-apps.png)
<Badge>5</Badge> In my case, transfer the file over to Dropbox
 
  ![](/assets/images/blog-posts/decode-apk/share-to-dropbox.png)

<Badge>6</Badge> Once the file transfer is complete, move the file to the folder where you downloaded the apktool

<Badge>7</Badge> Run the following command
`java -jar apktool.jar d <apk_name>`. In this case, it would be `java -jar apktool.jar d feh.apk`
If you are using Windows, you can run `apktool.bat d <apk_name>`  

<Badge>8</Badge> The outputted folder should have the assets you want but under **.bin.lz** format

<Badge>9</Badge> The following steps are specific for this apk.
**.bin.lz** are xor encrytpted lz77 files. 
We can use [FEHDataExtractor](https://github.com/Lorenzooone/FEHDataExtractor/releases) to grab the internal data
