**Prequisites**

* WinHex
* 7zip

Today we'll look into how to reverse engineer an executable file with unknown programming language origin

<Step number={1} title='Download WinHex as a prequisite for the following steps. You can find one with a license on a torrent site.'/>

<Step number={2} title='Open WinHex and drag in your .exe file'/>

<Step number={3} title='Start scrolling the hex of the .exe until you find something recognizable.'/>
In this case, I found code that could be an indication that it is Java code bundled into an .exe

> Note: We can also know this is a launch4j jar bundled inside an exe if we open the .exe with 7zip. It should be the following content structure

<Step number={4} title='Doing some research, we can see that if we can extract the hex starting from **PK** to the end of the hex, we can turn it back into a .jar file'/>

<Step number={5} title='Search for "META-INF" for the starting block. Right click the hex block starting with PK and select **Beginning of block**'/>

<Step number={6} title='Scroll down to the bottom and right click and set the last hex block as **End of block**'/>

<Step number={7} title='Right click the highlighted block and click **Edit**'/>

<Step number={8} title='Then click **Copy Block** followed by **Into New file** and name the file appended with .jar'/>

<Step number={9} title='Right click the .jar file and click **7-Zip** followed by **Open archive**'/>

<Step number={10} title='If done correctly, the jar should open as java class files'/>
