**Prerequisites**

* WinHex
* 7zip

Today we'll look into how to reverse engineer an executable file with unknown programming language origin

<Badge>1</Badge> Download WinHex as a prerequisite for the following steps.

You can find one with a license on a torrent site.  

<Badge>2</Badge> Open WinHex and drag in your .exe file

<Badge>3</Badge> Start scrolling the hex of the .exe until you find something recognizable.
In this case, I found code that could be an indication that it is Java code bundled into an .exe

> Note: We can also know this is a launch4j jar bundled inside an exe if we open the .exe with 7zip. It should be the following content structure

Doing some research, we can see that if we can extract the hex starting from **PK** to the end of the hex, we can turn it back into a .jar file

<Badge>5</Badge> 

Search for "META-INF" for the starting block. Right click the hex block starting with PK and select **Beginning of block**

<Badge>6</Badge> 

Scroll down to the bottom and right click and set the last hex block as **End of block**'

<Badge>7</Badge> 

Right click the highlighted block and click **Edit**

<Badge>8</Badge> 

Then click **Copy Block** followed by **Into New file** and name the file appended with .jar

<Badge>9</Badge> 

Right click the .jar file and click **7-Zip** followed by **Open archive**

<Badge>10</Badge> 

If done correctly, the jar should open as java class files
