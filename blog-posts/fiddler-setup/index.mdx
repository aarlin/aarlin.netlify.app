This is my first guide on setting up Fiddler.  
The documentation on Fiddler site is pretty good but but they're missing a little something.  
This guide is focused on getting a Windows machines looking at iPhone's mobile traffic.  
There will be some blog posts in the future where I use Fiddler so I think it's a good start for anyone who wants to try it themselves  

Why should you use Fiddler? Well it's a good way to look at your mobile phone's traffic  
An example, see how some of your apps interact by calling a backend and you can sometimes reverse engineer these backend calls on Postman  

If you ever used Charles proxy or WireShark, it is essentially the same thing  
I didn't have much luck with Charles proxy on Windows so this can serve as an alternative to it,
plus Charles proxy has a 30 day trial period while Fiddler is entirely free.

> Okay, you got me convinced! How do I set it up?

**_Disclaimer_**: This is done on a Windows 10 machine & iPhone 8 on iOS 13.3
