<Badge>2</Badge> Use a site like apkpure.com to download the apk you want to look into
For this guide, we'll be this [apk](https://m.apkpure.com/eme-hive-meet-chat-go-live/com.eastmeeteast.eme_android)

<Badge>3</Badge> Open Bytecode Viewer using the following command
```bash
java -jar jda-1.2.0-with-deps
```

<Badge>4</Badge> You should see the application open up, with an option to drag a .jar file into the top left window

<Badge>7</Badge> Looking through we can see several things about this application

a. The usage of Firebase  
b. Kotlin based application  
c. Source code under `com.eastmeeteast`  

<Badge>8</Badge> Looking at one .class file, we can see the implementation. Example shown below is for `com.eastmeeteast.api.servicemodule.CommunitiesModule.class`

<Badge>9</Badge> You can change which disassembler/decompiler you use to view .class files under `View > Pane 1 OR Pane 2 OR Pane 3`
As an example, I set pane 3 to be bytecode
