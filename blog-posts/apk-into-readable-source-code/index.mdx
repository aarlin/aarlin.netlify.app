**Prequisites**

* Java - should be able to run `java -version` in your terminal
* Bytecode Viewer

1. Download the jar for Bytecode Viewer located at this link: [page](https://github.com/Konloch/bytecode-viewer/releases)

2. Use a site like apkpure.com to download the apk you want to look into  
For this guide, we'll be this [apk](https://m.apkpure.com/eme-hive-meet-chat-go-live/com.eastmeeteast.eme_android)

3. Open Bytecode Viewer using the following command
```bash
java -jar jda-1.2.0-with-deps
```

4. You should see the application open up, with an option to drag a .jar file into the top left window

5. Drag in the apk downloaded in step 2

6. You should see the source code after the application has processed the apk

7. Looking through we can see several things about this application  

a. The usage of Firebase  
b. Kotlin based application  
c. Source code under `com.eastmeeteast`  

8. Looking at one .class file, we can see the implementation. Example shown below is for `com.eastmeeteast.api.servicemodule.CommunitiesModule.class`

9. You can change which disassembler/decompiler you use to view .class files under `View > Pane 1 OR Pane 2 OR Pane 3`
As an example, I set pane 3 to be bytecode

10. Hit the `Refresh` button under Workspace window and you should see the pane changed to whatever you wanted to view the code in
