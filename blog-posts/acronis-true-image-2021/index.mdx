Today, we're looking at setting up Acronis True Image 2021

Why you may ask a 2021 program in 2023?

Well, it's a way to restore a operating system back from a save state.  
This is useful for people who want to share their operating system with specific programs already downloaded or a particular configuration

Acronis themselves have scrubbed the program off their site (for most part).  
Going through the website's product page, there isn't even a mention of it in the legacy products section

If you want the `.iso` then you can download it from the Acronis site: `https://dl.acronis.com/s/AcronisTrueImage2021.iso`

However, here is a link to a patched variant:

The steps are inside the `.rar`, but here it is copied over:

<Badge>1</Badge> Turn off your internet

<Badge>2</Badge> Uninstall old Acronis version  
Delete all bak-files in `"C:\Program Files (x86)\Acronis\TrueImageHome\"` and `"C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Acronis\TrueImageHome\"` (x64-version)

<Badge>3</Badge> Run the `AcronisTrueImage2021.exe` file

<Badge>4</Badge> Install the program, and when the installation finishes closing (don't start True Image!)

<Badge>5</Badge> Wait about 20 seconds while the backgrounds are still working

<Badge>6</Badge> Run the `ATI2021_ActivationScript` file, located in the folder `(2.Patch)`

<Badge>7</Badge> It will take us a message Do (Do you want to proceed? [Y/N]

<Badge>8</Badge> It will get us a message (Press any key to exit ...)  
we press any key we want and we are done
