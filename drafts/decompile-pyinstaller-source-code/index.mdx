**Prerequisites**

* WinHex
* 7zip



<Badge>1</Badge> Download WinHex as a prequisite for the following steps. You can find one with a license on a torrent site.

<Badge>2</Badge> Open WinHex and drag in your .exe file

<Badge>3</Badge> Start scrolling the hex of the .exe until you find something recognizable.
In this case, I found code that could be an indication that it is Java code bundled into an .exe

> We can also know this is a launch4j jar bundled inside an exe if we open the .exe with 7zip. It should be the following content structure

<Badge>4</Badge> Doing some research, we can see that if we can extract the hex starting from **PK** to the end of the hex, we can turn it back into a .jar file

<Badge>5</Badge> Search for "META-INF" for the starting block. Right click the hex block starting with PK and select **Beginning of block**

<Badge>6</Badge> Scroll down to the bottom and right click and set the last hex block as **End of block**

<Badge>8</Badge> Then click **Copy Block** followed by **Into New file** and name the file appended with .jar

<Badge>9</Badge> Right click the .jar file and click **7-Zip** followed by **Open archive**

<Badge>10</Badge> If done correctly, the jar should open as java class files
