This is my first guide on setting up Fiddler.  
Bear with me in my journey making meaningful blog posts and tutorials  
There will be some blog posts where I use Fiddler so I think it's a good start for anyone who wants to try it themselves  

Why should you use Fiddler? Well it's a good way to look at your mobile phone's traffic
An example, see how some of your apps interact by calling a backend and you can sometimes reverse engineer 
these backend calls on Postman

If you ever used Charles proxy or WireShark, it is essentially the same thing
I didn't have much luck with Charles proxy on Windows so this can serve as an alternative to it, 
plus Charles proxy has a 30 day trial period while Fiddler is entirely free.

> Okay, you got me convinced! How do I set it up?

***Disclaimer***: This is done on a Windows 10 machine
    iPhone 8 on iOS 13.3

The documentation on Fiddler site is pretty good but this guide is focused on getting a Windows machines looking at iPhone's mobile traffic.

13. Hover over the Online indicator at the far right of the Fiddler toolbar to display the IP addresses assigned to Fiddler's machine. Usually this is the bottommost IP address
