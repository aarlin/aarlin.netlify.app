## **Prequisites**

* Python
* 7zip

For more context, this tutorial is following similar steps to this post originally from [HttpToolkit blogspot](https://httptoolkit.com/blog/frida-certificate-pinning/), however under Windows

The endgoal of this tutorial is to be able to look into HTTPS requests for an Android app that has been SSL certificate pinned.

## **LDPlayer9 Installation**

First we're going to need an Android emulator

Download and install [LDPlayer9](https://www.ldplayer.net/) OR use the [direct download link](https://ldcdn.ldmnq.com/download/ldad/LDPlayer9.exe?n=LDPlayer9_ens_1001_ld.exe)

Open the emulator, and it should look like this when started, minus the apps I have already installed 

![](./images/3.png)

Once you have it installed, go to the `Settings` page under the gear icon on the right side menu

![](./images/4.png)

It should open up to a screen like this

![](./images/5.png)

Under `Other settings`, set the following options:

Root permission: `Enable`  
ADB debugging: `Open local connection`

![](./images/6.png)

Click `Save settings` and it'll ask you to restart the emulator

Finally, you should drag and drop your `.apk` file into anywhere on the emulator screen.  
Once it appears on your home screen, open up the application.

## **Frida** 

**TL;DR**: Frida allows us to bypass SSL certificate pinning

Clone this repository: https://github.com/httptoolkit/frida-android-unpinning

```bash
git clone git@github.com:httptoolkit/frida-android-unpinning.git
```

Change directory into the cloned repository

```bash
cd frida-android-unpinning
```

Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv frida
```

Activate the virtual environment

```bash
frida\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Install frida-tools

```bash
pip install frida-tools
```

Make sure `frida-tools` was installed by running `frida-ps`

```bash
frida-ps
```

## ADB Tools

Install the `SDK Platform-Tools for Windows` from this [link](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools#downloads)

Double check that it installed and is working properly

```bash
adb
```

## Frida Server

Install Frida Android server from [here](https://github.com/frida/frida/releases/download/16.0.10/frida-server-16.0.10-android-x86_64.xz) or check the most up-to-date version from https://github.com/frida/frida/releases

The current version as of this tutorial is `16.0.10`.  
We're using `x86_64` version because we're going to be using `LDPlayer9` on Windows  


Unzip the `.xz` file using `7zip`  
Drop the unzipped file into `frida-android-unpinning` folder  

It should look like the following after everything

![](./images/7.png)

Make sure your emulator is visible 

```bash
adb devices -l
```

![](./images/8.png)

Start the emulator as root
```bash
adb root
```

![](./images/9.png)

```bash
adb push frida-server-16.0.10-android-x86_64 /data/local/tmp/frida-server
```

![](./images/10.png)


```bash
adb shell "chmod 755 /data/local/tmp/frida-server"
```

![](./images/11.png)


Start the frida server. You shouldn't see any errors if it started correctly

```bash
adb shell "/data/local/tmp/frida-server &"
```

![](./images/12.png)

Open up another terminal

Find the app identifier after opening the app
```bash
frida-ps -U -a
```

![](./images/13.png)

In my case, it is `com.p1.mobile.putong`. Now run the following command

```bash
frida -U -l ./frida-script.js -f com.p1.mobile.putong
```

**HTTPToolkit**

Install the community edition of HTTPToolkit: https://httptoolkit.com/download/win-exe/

It should automatically start downloading

Once installed it should look like this

![](./images/15.png)

Click `Android device via ADB`

![](./images/16.png)

Go to LDPlayer9, and allow the connection to be made

![](./images/17.png)

![](./images/18.png)

Open the app you want to monitor traffic for again

Finally, you should the requests populate on HTTP HttpToolkit

![](./images/19.png)

## Shortened Steps After Installation

Open LDPlayer9 and start the app you want to monitor

![](./images/20.png)

Open up a terminal and change directory into the cloned repository

```bash
cd frida-android-unpinning
```

Open up a terminal and start the emulator as root
```bash
adb root
```

![](./images/9.png)

Start the Frida server

```bash
adb shell "/data/local/tmp/frida-server &"
```

![](./images/12.png)

Open up another terminal

Activate the virtual environment

```bash
frida\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Find the app identifier after opening the app
```bash
frida-ps -U -a
```

![](./images/13.png)

```bash
frida -U -l ./frida-script.js -f com.p1.mobile.putong
```

![](./images/14.png)

Open HTTP Toolkit

Click `Android device via ADB`
