**Prequisites**
* Java - should be able to run `java -version` in your terminal
* Apktool - https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/install/
* Android device 

I'll be using a physical Android device for this guide
This a quick guide on how to grab assets from an APK folder
For my personal use case, this will be for Fire Emblem Heroes

1. Follow the steps for the page above to get the apktool downloaded. 
   Keep this jar file and bat file if you're using Windows in a folder. We'll get back to this later.

2. Download the app you want to decode assets from

3. Go search under your apps - **Files**
 ![](./photos/)
4. Under **Installed apps**, click on the app you want to export the APK file

5. Click the arrow button and click **Share**

6. In my case, transfer the file over to Dropbox

7. Once the file transfer is complete, move the file to the folder where you downloaded the apktool 

8. Do a quick rename of the apk file. If you are using cmder / bash on Windows, the command is `mv <original_apk_filename> <output_apk_filename>`

9. Run the command `apktool d <apk_name>`. In this case, it would be `apktool d feh.apk`

10. The outputted folder should have the assets you want but under **.bin.lz** format
