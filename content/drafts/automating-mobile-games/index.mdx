Wowee!

I wanted to code on iOS ... boy what a challenge this was
here were my steps
START here:
code in iOS
do you have a mac?
no,
do you have a laptop?
yes
do you want to use a VM? NO!!

ok, make a hackintosh JUMBLED MESS trying to setup hackintosh
install hackintosh into hard drive partition
install ubuntu
make bootloading work for all my operating systems

ok cool. does your usb support display.. no
does your usb c support display no, couldnt get it working
does your hdmi support display. no, tied to nvidia gpu.

MESS AROUND WITH USB MAPPING AND KEXTS AND ALL THIS OTHER JUNKED INSIDE SIMPLE NOTE

return all these docks

DOES AIRPLAY WORK?

yes!!

get an apple tv

does clamshell mode work. no...
settle for second monitor display, trackpad on big monitor isnt great

setup new environment
