wifi card

ok cool. does your usb support display.. no
does your usb c support display no, couldnt get it working

Meat of the blog post

AirTest!! Open source IDE for testing and automating things. I was looking around for an automation framework for
mobile devices and I came across this. Since I'm not as experienced with mobile programming & seemed interesting
Picked this open source project up

How to get started

`git clone git@github.com:AirtestProject/iOS-Tagent.git`

XCode > Open.. > WebDriverAgentRunner.xcodeproj

product > Scheeme > WebDriverAgentRunner
product > Destination

Signing for "WebDriverAgentRunner" requires a development team. Select a development team in the Signing & Capabilities editor.

Click on the base project itself 
Signing & Capabilities > Team > Add Account...

![](./signing_certificates.png)

![](development_login.png)

Choose your team
![](./choose_team.png)

If you encounter this following issue with unique build identifier
![](./bundle_identifier.png)

I suggest going to settings > display & brightness > auto-Lock > never

Go to Project > Build Settings > Packaging > Product Bundler Identifier > Change this 
append something to the end

Go under Product > Test again and rebuild

if this error pops up

go to General > 

If you encounter this error: 

Then you need to Settings > General > Profiles & Device Management > Developer App > Apple Development Profile >
